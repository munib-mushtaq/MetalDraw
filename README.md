# SceneKit and Metal Integration with Realistic Physics

This iOS app demonstrates the integration of SceneKit with Metal for rendering and realistic physics interactions. Users can interact with the scene by tapping to add new objects and observe their realistic physics behavior.

## Features

- Metal framework integration for custom rendering.
- Realistic physics behavior, including object restitution (bouncing).
- User interaction to add new objects and apply forces to existing objects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode (version X or later)
- iOS device

### Build and Run

1. Open the Xcode project file (`Physics Simulation.xcodeproj`) in Xcode.
2. Choose a target device (e.g., iPhone) and build the project.
3. Run the app on the selected device.

## Project Structure

- `ViewController.swift`: Main view controller handling Metal integration, SceneKit setup, camera, floor, dynamic nodes, and user interactions.

## Usage

- Tap on the screen to add a new dynamic node (cube).
- Tap on an existing cube to apply an upward force.
- Observe the realistic physics interactions, including bouncing.

## Customization

- Adjust physics properties, such as restitution, to fine-tune the behavior of objects.
- Experiment with different Metal rendering techniques in the `MTKViewDelegate` extension.

## Assumptions and Considerations

- The app assumes the use of SceneKit for high-level scene management and Metal for custom rendering.
- Realistic physics interactions are achieved through SceneKit's physics engine.
